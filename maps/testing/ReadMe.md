#TopoJSON description

more information can be seen at https://github.com/topojson/topojson/wiki/Introduction

TopoJSON uses arcs which are a set of points joined together using a relative coordinate system.

Arcs are predefied and different polygons are distinguished by using these predefined arcs. 

negative arc numbers imply a reversal in direction of the points taken by the arc.
